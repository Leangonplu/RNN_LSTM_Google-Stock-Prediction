# RNN_LSTM_Google-Stock-Prediction

## Predicting Google Actions with LSTM
This repository contains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to analyze and predict Google actions.

## Description
This project was designed to understand and predict changes in Google stock price. We used a recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to accomplish this due to its ability to learn long and complex temporal sequences, which are typical in financial time series data.

## Features
- Loading of historical stock data from Google
- Preprocessing of the data and creation of a time series dataset
- Design of an RNN with LSTM layers for time series forecasting
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of model predictions
